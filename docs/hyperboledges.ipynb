    "# Online Tree Metric Approximation through Hyperbolic Commute Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the previous (observation-MSTs). \n",
    "\n",
    "What if the ultimate goal of an annotator was _specifically_ to extract tree-like structure, such as taxonomy. \n",
    "See: nickel & kiela, etc. \n",
    "In this case, we need to enforce a tree-like distance metric that is used prior to downstream \n",
    "(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than simply using DS or a commute-kernel, we want a graph-smoothing process that _also_ biases the kernel toward being \"tree-like\". This is the hyperbolicity, and we can measure the distortion of a given metric space using the gromov product and the 4-point condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "We show that the use of an exponential map of a graph's Laplacian can be performed by viewing it as a grammian matrix of the vertices existing on a high-dimensional \"edge\" manifold. \n",
    "This is the same as using the incidence matrix (i.e.. the bipartite adjacency matrix of the Caley graph) as a set of \"observations\", with observations $V$ and feature space of dimension $\\|E\\|$. \n",
    "\n",
    "if we say the original vertices are data points $V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\|E\\|}$, then we actually recover exactly the original Laplacian $L$ as the linear kernel! \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we assume $V\\in\\mathcal{H}^{1,\\|E\\|}$, where $\\mathcal{H}^{1,n}$ is the n-dimensional upper-half plane (lorentzian) hyperbolic manifold embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ \n",
    "We can now compute a \"hyperbolic laplacian\", by interpreting it as the exponential map of the linear kernel into the hyperbolic plane. "
